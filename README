tcp-intercept
=============

This program is designed to intercept TCP connections passing through this box.
This can be set up using the TPROXY-target of iptables, together with the
appropriate `ip route` setup. See kernel/Documentation/networking/tproxy.txt for
details.


Rationale
---------

The idea is to add perform TCP-acceleration on unaware endpoints. This
acceleration can consist of using MultiPath-TCP, using another congestion
control algorithm, or both.

Other projects exist to simply add MPTCP-support to existing connections on the
netfilter-layer. This is more performant, since it doesn't maintain any buffers.
In order to change the congestion control however, intermediate buffers are
needed.
